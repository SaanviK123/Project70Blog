        <p class = "text-muted text-left">Qaint little restaurant tucked inside a bylane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi Cafe" while you are on the mian road. The restaurant has a reasonably good meny at reasona ble prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts uite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other says, the crowd thre is pretty hip and happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi Theater Fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <p class = "text-muted text-left">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

        <p>Great movie, loved it. I really anjoyed the action and suspense in the movie. It is a nail-biting thriller movie that the whole family will enjoy. A note of caution: Use the restroom before the movie because it is very long. In the middle of the movie, you won't want to miss anything!</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. Spread of COVID-19 occurs via airborne particles and droplets. People who are infected with COVID can release particles and droplets of respiratory fluids that contain the SARS CoV-2 virus into the air when they exhale (e.g., quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing). </p>
